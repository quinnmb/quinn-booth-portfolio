Welcome to my Github Portfolio! So far, I have three projects uploaded:

1. CatcherReports: This project models and visualizes defensive catcher performance, creating easily sharable and interpretable PDFs. The current model is trained on Cape League data, but in the future can be expanded to any league with Trackman or similar data. My next goal is to use the wealth of StatCast catching data to improve on these reports for MLB catchers. Read more here: https://quinnbooth.substack.com/p/cape-league-catcher-reports
   
2. HitterReports: This script generates PDF reports for baseball hitters based on their performance data for scouting and pitch planning purposes. I created these reports direct to coach requests late in the Cape season, integrating all charts and stats they said they needed. It extracts data from a MongoDB collection or Trackman file, processes it to compute statistics, and visualizes key metrics as heatmaps and tables. Each report is split by the pitcher's throwing hand (left or right) in order to best create pitch plans.
  
3. Stuff+: This project builds a machine learning model to predict the value of a pitch based on NCAA D1 Trackman  data. It organizes pitches into three categoriesâ€”Fast, Breaking, and Offspeed to compare/regress pitches to their similar type. It also normalizes pitches to a 100 scale for easy comparison. 

Each one of these projects has a seperate README file inside their folder for further explanation.

Explanations of my process on some of these projects, plus others, are available here: https://quinnbooth.substack.com/
